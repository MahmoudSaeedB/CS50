Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 
With a small number of simulations:
Spain: 20.0% chance of winning
Argentina: 20.0% chance of winning
Sweden: 10.0% chance of winning
Portugal: 10.0% chance of winning

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 
It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 100000 simulations.
